## Sooner

* Add token location (line, pos) to text parser tokens
* Proper module instantiation
* Proper function invocation
* Proper block handling
* Memories
* Tables
* Implement more instructions
* Extended instructions generator
* Host Functions
* Validation
* WASM test suite parser
* Pass WASM test suite
* Benchmarks

## Maybe later

* Investigate idea of creating structs for instructions + operands, and storing
  them as raw bytes in function instantiations.

* Explore typing ideas for things that are "Box<[T]>" --- maybe define a newtype?
