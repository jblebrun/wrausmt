/// A memory instance is the runtime representation of a linear memory. [Spec][Spec]

/// It records its type and holds a vector of bytes.
///
/// The length of the vector always is a multiple of the WebAssembly page size,
/// which is defined to be the constant 65536 â€“ abbreviated 64Ki
///
/// The bytes can be mutated through memory instructions, the execution of an
/// active data segment, or by external means provided by the embedder.
/// It is an invariant of the semantics that the length of the byte vector,
/// divided by page size, never exceeds the maximum size of memtype, if present.
